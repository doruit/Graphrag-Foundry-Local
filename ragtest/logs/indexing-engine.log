Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\nnever believed it until now.\n\nNo, nor did he believe it even now.

At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n\'Why, it\'s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it\'s Fezziwig alive again!\'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\njovial voice--\n\n\'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\'\n\nScrooge\'s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-\'prentice.\n\n\'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\' said Scrooge to the Ghost. \'Bless me, yes.\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,\ndear!\'\n\n\'Yo ho, my boys!\' said Fezziwig. \'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let\'s have the shutters up,\' cried old\nFezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \'before a man can say Jack\nRobinson!\'\n\nYou wouldn\'t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had \'em up in their\nplaces--four, five, six--barred \'em and pinned \'em--seven, eight,\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\nracehorses.\n\n\'Hilli-ho!\' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\nwonderful agility. \'Clear away, my lads, and let\'s have lots of room\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\'\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn\'t have cleared away, or\ncouldn\'t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\nsee upon a winter\'s night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\ncook with her brother\'s particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.

At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\njovial voice--\n\n'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'\n\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n\n'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes.\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,\ndear!'\n\n'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old\nFezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack\nRobinson!'\n\nYou wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their\nplaces--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\nracehorses.\n\n'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\nwonderful agility. 'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or\ncouldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\nsee upon a winter's night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\ncook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all\ncame, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\nevery how.

As to _her_, she\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that\'s not\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I\'ll use it. A positive light appeared\nto issue from Fezziwig\'s calves.

Mr. and Mrs.\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\n\'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\nin the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n\'A small matter,\' said the Ghost, \'to make these silly folks so full of\ngratitude.\'\n\n\'Small!\' echoed Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\nsaid:\n\n\'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\'\n\n\'It isn\'t that,\' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \'It isn\'t that,\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\nis impossible to add and count \'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\'\n\nHe felt the Spirit\'s glance, and stopped.\n\n\'What is the matter?\' asked the Ghost.\n\n\'Nothing particular,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Something, I think?\' the Ghost insisted.\n\n\'No,\' said Scrooge, \'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\nto my clerk just now. That\'s all.\'\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n\'My time grows short,\' observed the Spirit. \'Quick!\'\n\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\nthe growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n\'It matters little,\' she said softly. \'To you, very little. Another idol\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\'\n\n\'What Idol has displaced you?\' he rejoined.\n\n\'A golden one.\'\n\n\'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\' he said. \'There is\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\'\n\n\'You fear the world too much,\' she answered gently. \'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\'\n\n\'\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

Mr. and Mrs.\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\n'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\nin the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of\ngratitude.'\n\n'Small!' echoed Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\nsaid:\n\n'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'\n\n'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. 'It isn't that,\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\nis impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'\n\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost.\n\n'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted.\n\n'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\nto my clerk just now. That's all.'\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit. 'Quick!'\n\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\nthe growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n'It matters little,' she said softly. 'To you, very little. Another idol\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.'\n\n'What Idol has displaced you?' he rejoined.\n\n'A golden one.'\n\n'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!' he said. 'There is\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!'\n\n'You fear the world too much,' she answered gently. 'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'"}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don\'t mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge\'s hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge\'s time,\nor Marley\'s, or for many and many a winter season gone.

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam.

The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly.

If this had never been between us,'\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; 'tell me,\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!'\n\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of\nhimself. But he said, with a struggle, 'You think not.'\n\n'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,' she answered. 'Heaven\nknows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and\nirresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,\nyesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless\ngirl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by\nGain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and\nregret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,\nfor the love of him you once were.'\n\n[Illustration: SHE LEFT HIM, AND THEY PARTED]\n\nHe was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed:\n\n'You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have\npain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the\nrecollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it\nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have\nchosen!'\n\nShe left him, and they parted.\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge, 'show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you\ndelight to torture me?'\n\n'One shadow more!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\n'No more!' cried Scrooge. 'No more! I don't wish to see it. Show me no\nmore!'\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\nto observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\nyoung brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its"}

Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge.

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this?

But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract\nthe least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace\nwas an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all\nround with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,\nAngelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\nfeather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\nbutter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,\nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\nfirst, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\nold Marley's head on every one.\n\n'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\n\nAfter several turns he sat down again.

At length it\nbroke upon his listening ear.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'A quarter past,' said Scrooge, counting.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'Half past,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'A quarter to it.' said Scrooge.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'The hour itself,' said Scrooge triumphantly, 'and nothing else!'\n\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\ndull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the\ninstant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not\nthe curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to\nwhich his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside;\nand Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself\nface to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as\nI am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n\nIt was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like\nan old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the\nappearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a\nchild's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its\nback, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and\nmuscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.\nIts legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper\nmembers, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist\nwas bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a\nbranch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction\nof that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But\nthe strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there\nsprang a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and\nwhich was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,\nwas _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and\nglittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one\ninstant"}

It was a much greater surprise to\nScrooge to recognise it as his own nephew\'s and to find himself in a\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n\n\'Ha, ha!\' laughed Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Ha, ha, ha!\'\n\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed\nin a laugh than Scrooge\'s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to\nknow him too. Introduce him to me, and I\'ll cultivate his acquaintance.\n\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\nis infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge\'s\nnephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and\ntwisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge\'s\nniece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he.

Ha, ha, ha, ha!\'\n\n\'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\' cried Scrooge\'s\nnephew. \'He believed it, too!\'\n\n\'More shame for him, Fred!\' said Scrooge\'s niece indignantly.

I mean\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can\'t help\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\ntemper, year after year, and saying, "Uncle Scrooge, how are you?" If it\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that\'s_\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.\'\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\nit. Scrooge\'s niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\ntunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\nit in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\nScrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\nof Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\nthat Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\nand thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\nmight have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\nhis own hands, without resorting to the sexton\'s spade that buried Jacob\nMarley.\n\n[Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace\ntucker!_]\n\nBut they didn\'t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\nplayed at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\nStop! There was first a game at blind man\'s-buff. Of course there was.\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\nin his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\nScrooge\'s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn\'t catch anybody else. If you had\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn\'t\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge\'s niece was not one of the blind man\'s-buff party, but was made\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge\'s nephew, beat her sisters\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

If you had\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn\'t\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge\'s niece was not one of the blind man\'s-buff party, but was made\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge\'s nephew, beat her sisters\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to'}
