The Ghost is depicted as a tall, stately, and fearsome figure who communicates solely through gestures, never speaking a word. Its primary role is to show Scrooge haunting visions of the future, including the consequences of his current behavior and, most notably, Scrooge's own death. The spirit reveals a grim and desolate future that awaits Scrooge if he does not change his miserly and unkind ways.
