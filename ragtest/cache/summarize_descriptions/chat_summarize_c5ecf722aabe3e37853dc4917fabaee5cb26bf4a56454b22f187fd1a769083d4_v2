In \"Marley's Ghost,\" Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley. Marley’s ghost appears to warn Scrooge about the dire consequences of his miserly and unkind ways, sharing his own suffering as a cautionary example. Marley tells Scrooge that he is doomed to wander the earth in chains as punishment for his greed and lack of compassion in life. He urges Scrooge to change his ways to avoid a similar fate and foretells the coming of three spirits who will visit Scrooge in the following nights.
